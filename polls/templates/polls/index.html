        <!--  Removing hardcoded URLs in templates : 

            Remember, when we wrote the link to a question in the polls/index.html template, 
            the link was partially hardcoded like this:

                <li><a href="/polls/[[ question.id ]]/">[[ question.question_text ]]</a></li> 

            The problem with this hardcoded, 
            tightly-coupled approach is that it becomes challenging to change URLs on projects with a lot of templates. 
            
            However, since you defined the name argument in the path() functions in the polls.urls module, 
            you can remove a reliance on specific URL paths defined in your url configurations 
            by using the [% url %] template tag:
            curly bracked replaced with [] because of the confligs
        -->
        <li><a href="{% url 'polls:detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>
        <!-- 
            The way this works is by looking up the URL definition as specified in the 'polls.urls' module. 
            You can see exactly where the URL name of ‘detail’ is defined below:

                ...
                # the 'name' value as called by the [% url %] template tag
                path('<int:question_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),
                ...

            to point at the namespaced detail view:
                href="[% url 'polls:detail' question.id %]"
            old code (without namespacing) :
                href="[% url 'detail' question.id %]" 
         -->

    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
